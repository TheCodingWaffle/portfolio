title: super-spork, summary: A NestJs service able to be clone and ready to serve thousands of requests. (the name was auto generated, and I love it!), description: This NestJs service isnâ€™t RESTful but instead uses power GraphQL query framework. NestJs is influenced from the Angular framework and drastically reduces context switching if your client is using Angular. GraphQL solved the over fetching dilemma that most shops find them selves in. This project also has a work JWT implementation and utilizes it with Auth Guards to protect specific routes., github: https://github.com/TheCodingWaffle/super-spork
