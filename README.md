# Project

Hello, Thanks for stopping by. This project is really a showcase of other repositories i've worked on. It's a simple html, JS, and CSS site which links other repositories I own or collaborate on. The site is currently hosted with Heroku. The code isn't much to look at but the UI is pretty sweet.
